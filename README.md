# emojifier
A simple wrapper class around [deepmoji](https://deepmoji.mit.edu/) model ([Huggingface example](https://github.com/huggingface/torchMoji)) -- the work was also published as a [paper (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00524.pdf).

## requirements
This assumes that torchMoji is installed following [this](https://github.com/huggingface/torchMoji). The torchMoji installation was tested with an older version of pytorch (1.0.1) -- I wasn't able to run it with 1.6.1 or newer.
